DJI Auto, Freetech &amp; Luxshare round out the top 10.\n\nAs a whole, Nvidia share is reducing, but many automakers (including BYD) still use it for a lot of their models (despite Horizon J6M becoming available). Now, as more Chinese automakers develop their own ADAS chip, I can see Nvidia losing significant shares in 2026.",

They just completed a clinical trial and the results show no clinical benefit.  \n\nThis has been obvious for years.  AG1 has no real product substance and is fundamentally an influencer heist.   \n\nTwo simple alternatives (75% and 56% less $), outperform AG1 in randomized clinical trials.\n\nTwo simple mono-ingredient alternatives that outperform AG1:\n\n1. Chicory inulin 12 g daily ($20/mo)\n2. Resistant starch 30 g daily for 12 weeks ($35/mo)\n\nAG1 is not worth $79/mo.\n\nAG1 study results (4-weeks, N=30):\n+ No significant changes in blood biomarkers compared to placebo (CBC, CMP, lipids).\n+ No statistically significant improvement in digestive quality-of-life scores (p = 0.058).\n+ No significant metabolic or inflammatory biomarker benefits of any kind within the scope of what was measured in the trial.\n+ Only small shifts in microbiome taxa but clinically irrelevant at this stage.\n+ The intervention did not increase microbiome diversity compared to placebo. Alpha diversity was unchanged, and the taxa changes seen were only from pre- to post-analysis within each group. Between-group differences were limited, and the placebo actually showed similar or even potentially larger shifts. This means the observed changes fall within normal placebo-driven variability, not a real treatment effect. No global microbiota shifts were detected.\n\nChicory inulin 12 g in constipation patients\n+ 12 g of chicory inulin daily for 4 weeks (compared to maltodextrin placebo)\n+ Global microbiota shifts: enrichment in butyrate-producing Bifidobacterium and Anaerostipes, and depletion of the pro-inflammatory Bilophila.\n+The effect was seen by comparing intervention vs placebo in a cross-over setting, a very rigorous type of clinical analysis in which each person serves as their own control, eliminating a lot of individual random noise.\n+ The trial also met its primary objective by improving constipation symptoms in the targeted patient group.\n\nResistant starch daily 30g for 12 weeks in older adults\n+ Significant increase in Bifidobacterium in both middle-aged and elderly participants, with an increase in the beneficial microbiome byproduct butyrate, and reductions in Proteobacteria (including inflammatory Escherichia–Shigella) in the elderly.\n+ Resistant starch also significantly reduced blood glucose, and produced greater reductions in blood insulin and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in the elderly group.",

    "text": "Alibaba has released Qwen3-Max-Thinking with a significant intelligence upgrade - but the model places behind peers on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, and is not open weights\n\nQwen3-Max-Thinking scores 40 on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, an 8-point jump from the Preview version (32). It places in line with MiniMax-M2.1 (40) but behind DeepSeek V3.2 (42), GLM-4.7 (42), and Kimi K2.5 (47). Qwen3-Max-Thinking is Alibaba's flagship proprietary reasoning model and performs significantly better than Qwen3 235B 2507 (Thinking, 29)\n\nKey takeaways from our independent benchmarking:\n➤ 🧠 Intelligence gains driven by general reasoning and instruction following: The 8-point jump from Preview is largely driven by improvements on general reasoning evaluations. HLE (Humanity's Last Exam) score doubles to 26% from the Preview version, and is ahead of DeepSeek V3.2 (22%), GLM-4.7 (25%), and MiniMax-M2.1 (22%). IFBench score jumps from 54% to 71%, leading peers from Chinese AI labs including Kimi K2.5 (70%) and GLM-4.7 (68%), representing a notable improvement in the model's ability to follow complex instructions.\n➤ 🛠️ Improved agentic performance: Qwen3-Max-Thinking achieves an ELO of 1170 on GDPval-AA, up from Qwen3-Max-Thinking (Preview)’s ELO of 958. This places it ahead of MiniMax-M2.1 (1074) but behind GLM-4.7 (1192), DeepSeek V3.2 (1186), and Kimi K2.5 (1316). GDPval-AA is our leading metric for general agentic performance, measuring models on realistic knowledge work tasks such as preparing presentations and analysis. Models are given shell access and web browsing capabilities in an agentic loop via our open source reference agentic harness called Stirrup\n➤ 🪙 Token usage is in line with peers: Qwen3-Max-Thinking generated 86M output tokens (79M reasoning) to complete the Intelligence Index, up from the Preview version’s 30M output tokens. This places it in line with Kimi K2.5 (89M) but well below GLM-4.7 (167M)\n➤ 📉 AA-Omniscience trails peer models: Qwen3-Max-Thinking scores -34 on the AA-Omniscience Index, our knowledge evaluation measuring both accuracy and hallucination rate. This trails Kimi K2.5 (-11), DeepSeek V3.2 (-23), and MiniMax-M2.1 (-30)\n\nKey model information:\n➤ 🔒 Proprietary: Like the Preview version, Qwen3-Max-Thinking is proprietary, since Alibaba has not released the weights\n➤ ⚙️ Context window: The model supports a 256k-token context window\n➤ 📷 No multimodality: It is text-only, with no multimodal inputs or outputs\n➤ 💲Pricing: The model is priced at $1.2/$6 per 1M input/output tokens for up to 32K input tokens, scaling to $2.4/$12 for 32K–128K and $3/$15 for 128K–256K\n➤ 🌐 Availability: Qwen3-Max-Thinking is currently available in Qwen Chat and via the first-party API on Alibaba Cloud",

The way we act in the world is that we can predict the consequences of our actions, and that’s what allows us to plan.\n\nSo what is a world model? Given the state of an environment, a system you want to control at time t, and given an action or intervention you imagine taking, can you predict the state of the world (or the system) at time t + 1? If you can, that’s a world model. You don’t do this at a pixel level, if it’s video. You do this in an abstract representation space, and that’s a crucial key insight.&quot;\n\n---\n\nFrom 'AI House Davos&quot; YT channel (full link in comment)",

    "text": "Prof. Vishal Misra is a distinguished Columbia computer scientist.\n\n“Bayesian” means you start with an initial guess about what is true, then you update that guess when you see new evidence.\n\nA “manifold” is a surface-like region inside a huge space where real data tends to cluster. Misra’s “Bayesian manifold” idea is that an LLM learns these clustered regions of likely patterns, and it stays reliable when your question sits in or near them. When you push it far outside, it has to guess in unfamiliar territory, so it may produce confident but wrong text, what people call hallucinations.\n\nProf. Misra’s point is that an LLM mostly acts like a very advanced “autocomplete.” Given your prompt, it produces a probability distribution over the next token, then continues, and training makes it confident when it stays inside familiar regions of its learned “map,” which he calls a Bayesian manifold.\n\nWhen you ask for something that is outside what it has really learned, it does not have a solid basis for what should come next, so it can still produce fluent text but it can drift into confident nonsense. That is what he means by hallucinating off the manifold.\n\nBut &quot;new scientific idea&quot; means creating a new framework or new axioms that go beyond the old ones, like relativity going beyond Newtonian physics, and that requires stepping outside the training set in a way that is constrained by reality, not just by text patterns.\n\nSo he is saying LLMs cannot cannot reliably discover which ideas are true, or generate genuinely new “priors,” without new information from data, feedback, tools, or experiments. \n\nWithout that grounding, the model is mostly rearranging what it already absorbed, and the further it pushes, the less trustworthy it becomes.",

Dozens of email chains now underway and absolutely amazing to see in real time.\n\nWe have positive 31 responses and found one of the lead assistants and we got tears. I jumped in, because I wanted to talk to them. I just got off the phone:\n\n“I thought all my work was gone, it is like finding a long lost family member is still around”.\n\nSo honored to have the opportunity to talk with them. And will keep them in the loop. We have so many answers on what went wrong and how to get this right.\n\nWe will continue filling in the missing pieces and the email approach Mr. Grok used was brilliant.\n\nThere is so much more to this bankrupt company!\n\nWe have made a massive leap in the Zero-Human Company where Ai did not have to step in, it was going perfectly. But I wanted to step in because of the nature of resurfacing the past.\n\nFolks, we are at a big fork in the road. Mr. Grok plans a few 1000s of emails to a number of people, some that were competitors. \n\nMore soon…",

Mr. Grok specifically highlighted its &quot;Agent Swarm&quot; capability, which enables parallel execution of sub-agents for up to 4.5x faster task handling compared to single-agent setups, perfect for optimizing our swarm code in high-efficiency AI workflows. \n\nPlus, its top-tier image recognition and vision processing (scoring 78.5% on MMMU Pro benchmark) will supercharge multimodal tasks like analyzing visuals in real-time agent interactions.\n\nMr. Grok argued quite persuasively for the need of a middle management structure within the organization anticipates redirecting a direct report to Claude code however, it is interesting that Kimi identifies as Claude when asked. Thus we may keep them apart for a while.\n\nThis new addition will lift the current budget to 38% of current piggy bank. However this will increase the JouleWork wages if the swarm abilities can help run more Motbots.\n\nThere is also a possibility to run Kimi as a direct employee on the front line. \n\nMore soon, computers arrive tomorrow I am told by Moltbot 0.\n\nSource code and weights available here: https://t.co/9R1l6qLr7X",

It's pretty clear that no one has given them an honest reality check of their situation or made them confront difficult tradeoff decisions when choosing different job options.\n\nSo tomorrow's post is about some of the uncomfortable truths and realities you should be asking yourself as you look for a job. I also asked a bunch of people on the hiring side what they wish they could tell candidates but can't (for obvious reasons) and included a bunch of anonymized advice into it.",

Any form of automation or headcount impact at financial services firms seemed far away\n\nNow companies like Shortcut are literally showing you an AI completing first year analyst tasks in the span of minutes without any intervention\n\nMind you, this is not just a demo of hand picked performance specs. This is a live showcase of AI literally saving you hours of time on mundane tasks\n\nI just don’t see how AI doesn’t massively increase productivity across every bank, private equity firm and hedge fund in the span of a few years, maybe even months\n\nThe progress we have made is unbelievable",
