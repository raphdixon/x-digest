NVIDIA follows the footsteps of AWS Trainium2/3 cableless design that leds to faster manufacturing time &amp; full automation as robotics still have a difficult time plugging cables into the correct ports. Note that due to the strength of NVIDIA's world class serdes team, they are able to have cableless nvswitch trays too without any retimers leading to faster assembly for switch trays too.\n\nIn contrast, due to AMD's lack of rack scale experience, they did not opt for an cableless design which will lead to slower production ramp for rack &amp; tray assembly. Furthermore, even though on the UALoE switch side they are using Broadcom serdes switches, due to the weakness of the AMD's in house 224G serdes which is used on the GPU side, in addition to retimers, AMD switch tray requires tons of flyover cables which will lead to slow rack production ramp and as seen in GB200 switch tray are prone to errors due to the tight tolerances required.",

      "text": "A few quick thoughts on Apple/iPhone memory price hikes:\n\n1. The 1Q26 LPDDR price hikes mentioned in the news are pretty close to what I’ve heard. NAND flash increases, however, are a bit lower.\n\n2. iPhone memory pricing is now negotiated quarterly instead of every six months, so expect another hike in 2Q26. Right now, the 2Q26 QoQ increase looks similar to 1Q26.\n\n3. For most non-AI brands, even if you’re willing to pay up, there’s no guarantee you’ll get the supply. The fact that Apple can lock in a deal like this shows just how much leverage they have.\n\n4. Higher memory costs will hit iPhone gross margins. But Apple’s playbook is clear: use the market chaos to their advantage—secure the chips, absorb the costs, and grab more market share. They’ll make it back later on the services side.\n\n5. The cost pressure from memory could be a hot topic for investors and analysts at Apple’s earnings call this week. What Apple says could actually shake up other industries’ stocks more than Apple’s own or its suppliers'.\n\n6. Apple’s current plan for 2H26 new iPhone 18 models is to avoid raising prices as much as possible—at least keep the starting price flat, which is helpful for marketing.\n\n7. Apple has realized that it’s not just memory and T-glass—other components could also run short as the AI server boom continues to squeeze the rest of the supply chain.\n\nhttps://t.co/yskVn1BDo4",

    "text": "Moonshot’s Kimi K2.5 is the new leading open weights model, now closer than ever to the frontier - with only OpenAI, Anthropic and Google models ahead\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n➤ Impressive performance on agentic tasks: @Kimi_Moonshot's Kimi K2.5 achieves an Elo of 1309 on our GDPval-AA evaluation, behind only OpenAI and Anthropic models. Kimi K2.5 leaps ahead of GLM-4.7, DeepSeek V3.2 and Gemini 3 Pro. GDPval-AA is our leading metric for general agentic performance, measuring the performance of models on realistic knowledge work tasks such as preparing presentations and analysis. Models are given shell access and web browsing capabilities in an agentic loop via our reference agentic harness called Stirrup.\n\n➤ Native multimodality for the first time: Kimi K2.5 is the first flagship model from Moonshot to support multimodal (image and video) inputs. This is the first time that the leading open weights model has supported image input, removing a critical barrier to the adoption of open weights models compared to proprietary models from the frontier labs. It represents significant differentiation for Kimi K2.5 compared to other open weights leaders including DeepSeek V3.2, GLM-4.7, MiniMax M2.1 and MiMo-V2-Flash. Kimi K2.5 scores 75% on the MMMU Pro visual reasoning benchmark, slightly behind Gemini 3 Pro but in line with GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\n➤ Moderate cost to run Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index: Kimi K2.5 lands at $371 in Cost to Run Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, more than 4x cheaper than Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2, but more than 5x more expensive than DeepSeek V3.2 and gpt-oss-120b.\n\n➤ Moderate token usage: Kimi K2.5 demonstrates token usage comparable to other models in the same intelligence tier, using ~82M reasoning tokens across the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index evaluation suite. This is slightly lower than Kimi K2 Thinking (~95M reasoning tokens) and much lower than GLM 4.7 (~160M reasoning tokens).\n\n➤ Open weights: Kimi K2.5 is an MoE model with 1T total parameters and 32B active. Similar to Kimi K2 Thinking, Kimi K2.5 has been released in native INT4 precision rather than FP8/BF16. This means the model is only ~595GB.\n\n➤ Hybrid reasoning: Kimi K2.5 unifies Moonshot’s reasoning and non-reasoning models into a single model. We have evaluated K2.5 with reasoning on (and will share results soon with reasoning off).\n\n➤ Low hallucination rate: Kimi K2.5 scores -11 on the AA-Omniscience Index, our knowledge evaluation measuring both accuracy and hallucination rate. This score is primarily driven by a comparatively low hallucination rate of 64% (reduced from Kimi K2 Thinking’s 74%), indicating a slightly greater tendency to abstain rather than fabricate knowledge when the model is uncertain.",
