    "text": "Moonshot’s Kimi K2.5 is the new leading open weights model, now closer than ever to the frontier - with only OpenAI, Anthropic and Google models ahead\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n➤ Impressive performance on agentic tasks: @Kimi_Moonshot's Kimi K2.5 achieves an Elo of 1309 on our GDPval-AA evaluation, behind only OpenAI and Anthropic models. Kimi K2.5 leaps ahead of GLM-4.7, DeepSeek V3.2 and Gemini 3 Pro. GDPval-AA is our leading metric for general agentic performance, measuring the performance of models on realistic knowledge work tasks such as preparing presentations and analysis. Models are given shell access and web browsing capabilities in an agentic loop via our reference agentic harness called Stirrup.\n\n➤ Native multimodality for the first time: Kimi K2.5 is the first flagship model from Moonshot to support multimodal (image and video) inputs. This is the first time that the leading open weights model has supported image input, removing a critical barrier to the adoption of open weights models compared to proprietary models from the frontier labs. It represents significant differentiation for Kimi K2.5 compared to other open weights leaders including DeepSeek V3.2, GLM-4.7, MiniMax M2.1 and MiMo-V2-Flash. Kimi K2.5 scores 75% on the MMMU Pro visual reasoning benchmark, slightly behind Gemini 3 Pro but in line with GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\n➤ Moderate cost to run Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index: Kimi K2.5 lands at $371 in Cost to Run Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, more than 4x cheaper than Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2, but more than 5x more expensive than DeepSeek V3.2 and gpt-oss-120b.\n\n➤ Moderate token usage: Kimi K2.5 demonstrates token usage comparable to other models in the same intelligence tier, using ~82M reasoning tokens across the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index evaluation suite. This is slightly lower than Kimi K2 Thinking (~95M reasoning tokens) and much lower than GLM 4.7 (~160M reasoning tokens).\n\n➤ Open weights: Kimi K2.5 is an MoE model with 1T total parameters and 32B active. Similar to Kimi K2 Thinking, Kimi K2.5 has been released in native INT4 precision rather than FP8/BF16. This means the model is only ~595GB.\n\n➤ Hybrid reasoning: Kimi K2.5 unifies Moonshot’s reasoning and non-reasoning models into a single model. We have evaluated K2.5 with reasoning on (and will share results soon with reasoning off).\n\n➤ Low hallucination rate: Kimi K2.5 scores -11 on the AA-Omniscience Index, our knowledge evaluation measuring both accuracy and hallucination rate. This score is primarily driven by a comparatively low hallucination rate of 64% (reduced from Kimi K2 Thinking’s 74%), indicating a slightly greater tendency to abstain rather than fabricate knowledge when the model is uncertain.",

AI has actually expanded their TAM, which is now the opportunity to displace labor by charging for outcomes instead of seats\n2. If a business currently spends $20-50 to close a support ticket, they are thrilled to pay 50 cents for AI to solve it, and potentially also have to hire fewer support reps. Similar dynamic with leads and business development reps \n3. No company actively wants to use another vendor. It is so so so so so much easier to just use your existing relationship and infrastructure \n4. Therefore, literally every customer just wants Salesforce or HubSpot or ServiceNow to just figure this out. They are rooting for them \n5. Even if they are testing other point solutions, they will absolutely switch if the SoR solution becomes good enough \n6. They just have to become good enough in the next 12-18 months.

The way we act in the world is that we can predict the consequences of our actions, and that’s what allows us to plan.\n\nSo what is a world model? Given the state of an environment, a system you want to control at time t, and given an action or intervention you imagine taking, can you predict the state of the world (or the system) at time t + 1? If you can, that’s a world model. You don’t do this at a pixel level, if it’s video. You do this in an abstract representation space, and that’s a crucial key insight.&quot;\n\n---\n\nFrom 'AI House Davos&quot; YT channel (full link in comment)",
