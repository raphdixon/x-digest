It does not excuse what I did though… I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I love Jewish people… To the black community - which held me down through all of the highs and lows and the darkest of times. The black community is, unquestionably, the foundation of who I am. I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us.\n\nIn early 2025, I fell into a four-month long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life. As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn’t want to be here anymore.\n\nHaving bipolar disorder is notable state of constant mental illness. When you go into a manic episode, you are ill at that point. When you are not in an episode, you are completely ‘normal’. And that’s when the wreckage from the illness hits the hardest. Hitting rock bottom a few months ago, my wife encouraged me to finally get help.\n\nI have found comfort in Reddit forums of all places. Different people speak of being in manic or depressive episodes of a similar nature. I read their stories and realized that I was not alone. It’s not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day and being told by the so-called best doctors in the world that I am not bipolar, but merely experiencing “symptoms of autism.”\n\nMy words as a leader in my community have global impact and influence. In my mania, I lost complete sight of that.\n\nAs I find my new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise, and clean living, I have newfound, much-needed clarity. I am pouring my energy into positive, meaningful art: music, clothing, design, and other new ideas to help the world.\n\nI’m not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness. I write today simply to ask for your patience and understanding as I find my way home.”\n\nWith love,\n\nYe\n\n(via Walla Street Journal)","url":"https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/2015784919402750190","likes":19775,"retweets":833,"category":"Tech Biz","addedAt":1769473812216,"addedDate":"2026-01-27 11:30","media":"image"},{"id":"2015762985378316743","author":"Zephyr","handle":"zephyr_z9","text":"Found a very interesting AI supply chain bottleneck","url":"https://x.com/zephyr_z9/status/2015762985378316743","likes":596,"retweets":6,"category":"AI","addedAt":1769473812217,"addedDate":"2026-01-27 11:30","media":null},{"id":"2015849410479964321","author":"intern","handle":"intern","text":"engineers watching the BD team use claude code https://t.co/d3HzsFLoyH","url":"https://x.com/intern/status/2015849410479964321","likes":1084,"retweets":56,"category":"AI","addedAt":1769473812217,"addedDate":"2026-01-27 11:30","media":"video"},{"id":"2015614650562355204","author":"Jake Motyl","handle":"jakewilliammo","text":"My dad got bored in retirement.
