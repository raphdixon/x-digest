The pace of new best practices emerging in AI is unlike anything that's happened in tech before.\n\nThe common trend is that we're all collectively figuring out the best ways to split work up between agents to enable them to do much more complicated tasks, handling vastly more information than the context window can natively support, finding the most relevant data to work with on the task, and mitigating the natural limits on the AI models.\n\nWhat's amazing is that for many of these areas of improvements, you can simply decide to throw more compute at the problem at any point to unlock another tranche of performance improvement. Of course the ultimate constraint then is what someone will pay to perform the task, but it's amazing that we always have this variable at our disposal.","url":"https://x.com/levie/status/2016727602619453888","likes":15,"retweets":0,"category":"AI","addedAt":1769661013266,"addedDate":"2026-01-29 15:30","media":null},{"id":"2016729180524998744","author":"Dan Nystedt","handle":"dnystedt","text":"RT @SawyerMerritt: Elon says chip production is the biggest limiting factor for future growth at Tesla.\n\n&quot;I think Tesla needs to build a te…","url":"https://x.com/dnystedt/status/2016729180524998744","likes":0,"retweets":126,"category":"Chips","addedAt":1769661013266,"addedDate":"2026-01-29 15:30","media":null},{"id":"2016728841365131406","author":"Chapo Trap House","handle":"CHAPOTRAPHOUSE","text":"RT @willmenaker: SELL THE TEAM!!!! 🇺🇸 https://t.co/6UPZc1OF5A","url":"https://x.com/CHAPOTRAPHOUSE/status/2016728841365131406","likes":0,"retweets":232,"category":"AI","addedAt":1769661013266,"addedDate":"2026-01-29 15:30","media":"image"},{"id":"2016726683903283395","author":"Prakash","handle":"8teAPi","text":"RT @niubi: &quot;Google has aimed a knockout blow at a massive cyber weapon that researchers say is running silently on millions of devices in t…","url":"https://x.com/8teAPi/status/2016726683903283395","likes":0,"retweets":13,"category":"Tech","addedAt":1769661013266,"addedDate":"2026-01-29 15:30","media":null},{"id":"2016725842198680014","author":"Daniel Lopez","handle":"NoLuckLopez","text":"He’s a crank and if you didn’t sense this at the outset, maybe work on developing your intellectual judgement.\n\nI mean, imagine thinking Western Marxism was a CIA psyop ffs.

Nevertheless, the earnings call focused investor attention on the 2026 outlook and pricing. Although the company did not provide 2026 gross margin guidance, management believes the pricing environment has become more favorable, but it gave mild guidance for 1Q26 (gross margin and utilization) and 2026 TAM, which implies potential stock price pullback. At the same time, the company stated that cooperation with Intel is progressing smoothly and expects silicon photonics and advanced packaging to become new drivers. As mentioned in our previous report, TSMC's (2330 TT Buy) reduction in mature process capacity is a key observation point and may gradually accelerate. Considering the earnings, guidance, and higher gross margin assumptions (partly benefiting from NT$ depreciation), we raise our 2026E/2027E earnings by 22% and 51%, respectively. Our target price of NT$67 is based on 15x 2026E/2027E P/E, and we roll our valuation method from 15x 2026E to 2026E/2027E to capture the long-term improvement in the pricing environment.\n\n☀️Improving Pricing Environment: Despite UMC's moderate overall utilization, its gross margins remain resilient, benefiting from positioning in specialty processes such as high-voltage, NVM, and BCD. From a supply perspective, given TSMC's tight advanced packaging capacity, we expect TSMC to gradually adjust its 8-inch and 12-inch lagging process capacities over the next three years, shifting toward advanced packaging. According to TrendForce, global 8-inch capacity will decline by 2.4% in 2026 and may accelerate in 2027 due to TSMC closing more 8-inch capacities. At the same time, restocking demand has emerged, as shown in TI's (TXN Buy) earnings call, where industrial sector pull-in demand has recovered. On the other hand, 28nm capacity in the industry is relatively aggressive, which has both positive and negative impacts on UMC.\n\n☀️Mild 1Q26 Guidance: 4Q25 earnings exceeded expectations, with EPS of NT$0.8, down 33% QoQ and up 19% YoY, mainly benefiting from gross margin improvement. Gross margin reached 30.7%, up 90 bps QoQ, primarily driven by NT$ depreciation and product mix. For 1Q26, the company guides wafer shipments to be flat QoQ, mainly due to seasonality, increased consumer demand, and declines in communications and automotive sectors, with USD-denominated ASP stable. Based on the current NT$ exchange rate, management expects gross margin in the high-20% range, which is below expectations, possibly due to depreciation cost impacts. For 2026, the company guides its business to outperform the addressable market, with the addressable market expected to grow in the low single digits YoY. On the other hand, depreciation expenses are expected to grow in the low-teens.","url":"https://x.com/jukan05/status/2016699270423072783","media":null}},{"id":"2016701824032456980","author":"@levelsio","handle":"levelsio","text":"Yep very much so, OpenAI feels like the Microsoft of the 90s, dominant player, not much taste and market manipulative actions\n\nAnthropic feels like Apple of the 90s more and more","url":"https://x.com/levelsio/status/2016701824032456980","likes":33,"retweets":2,"category":"AI","addedAt":1769655610464,"addedDate":"2026-01-29 14:00","media":null,"quotedTweet":{"author":"Vinícius Soares","handle":"sir_vcsoares","text":"@levelsio They are giving Apple vs Microsoft vibes.
