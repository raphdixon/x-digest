Kimi K2.5 leaps ahead of GLM-4.7, DeepSeek V3.2 and Gemini 3 Pro. GDPval-AA is our leading metric for general agentic performance, measuring the performance of models on realistic knowledge work tasks such as preparing presentations and analysis. Models are given shell access and web browsing capabilities in an agentic loop via our reference agentic harness called Stirrup.\n\n➤ Native multimodality for the first time: Kimi K2.5 is the first flagship model from Moonshot to support multimodal (image and video) inputs. This is the first time that the leading open weights model has supported image input, removing a critical barrier to the adoption of open weights models compared to proprietary models from the frontier labs. It represents significant differentiation for Kimi K2.5 compared to other open weights leaders including DeepSeek V3.2, GLM-4.7, MiniMax M2.1 and MiMo-V2-Flash. Kimi K2.5 scores 75% on the MMMU Pro visual reasoning benchmark, slightly behind Gemini 3 Pro but in line with GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\n➤ Moderate cost to run Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index: Kimi K2.5 lands at $371 in Cost to Run Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, more than 4x cheaper than Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2, but more than 5x more expensive than DeepSeek V3.2 and gpt-oss-120b.\n\n➤ Moderate token usage: Kimi K2.5 demonstrates token usage comparable to other models in the same intelligence tier, using ~82M reasoning tokens across the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index evaluation suite. This is slightly lower than Kimi K2 Thinking (~95M reasoning tokens) and much lower than GLM 4.7 (~160M reasoning tokens).\n\n➤ Open weights: Kimi K2.5 is an MoE model with 1T total parameters and 32B active. Similar to Kimi K2 Thinking, Kimi K2.5 has been released in native INT4 precision rather than FP8/BF16. This means the model is only ~595GB.\n\n➤ Hybrid reasoning: Kimi K2.5 unifies Moonshot’s reasoning and non-reasoning models into a single model. We have evaluated K2.5 with reasoning on (and will share results soon with reasoning off).\n\n➤ Low hallucination rate: Kimi K2.5 scores -11 on the AA-Omniscience Index, our knowledge evaluation measuring both accuracy and hallucination rate. This score is primarily driven by a comparatively low hallucination rate of 64% (reduced from Kimi K2 Thinking’s 74%), indicating a slightly greater tendency to abstain rather than fabricate knowledge when the model is uncertain.","url":"https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2016250137115557953","media":"image"}},{"id":"2016446780896858604","author":"Tom Warren","handle":"tomwarren","text":"Google just leaked a first look at Android for PC in action.

I don’t expect its viral success to last. \n\nDeepSeek largely replicates the capabilities of leading US models, which while impressive, also highlighted the limitations of current SOTA AI models in terms of what they can do, esp for average person’s daily lives. They are very useful information gatherers and powerful encyclopedia and excellent but still error-prone coding assistants. They by and large cannot actually “solve” problems by taking a project from start to finish at all. \n\nDeepSeek is ultimately a natural step in the scaling law progression. This is the progress we should expect along the way as compute gets cheaper and algorithms improve. Its discovery just gained prominence and caught public attention bc it came out of China, a perceived (some might say manufactured) geopolitical adversary for the American public conscious. And ofc the fact that everyone’s aped into AI stocks. \n\nAI still has long ways to go imo to become truly useful and beyond party tricks and gimmicks for non-coders and enthusiasts. That means much better algos and much faster compute. I certainly had my doubts: how’s it that a 70B parameters AI model requires so much energy to run but the human brain with similar number of neurons, albeit not the same thing despite analogy, uses only a tiny fraction of the energy? \n\nWhat DeepSeek has managed to do is to collectively demonstrate to the US and global public that the lofty Sci-Fi end goal that used to be casually dismissed even just a year ago may in fact be reachable through not just mind boggling hardware buildout but algorithmic efficiency gains.  The journey or race towards intelligence, wise or not, has truly just begun.","url":"https://x.com/stevehou/status/1884189182475514308","media":null}},{"id":"2016398190271168934","author":"Dan Nystedt","handle":"dnystedt","text":"RT @ASMLcompany: BREAKING: $ASML reports €9.7 billion total net sales, gross margin of 52.2%, and €2.8 billion net income in Q4 2025 and fu…","url":"https://x.com/dnystedt/status/2016398190271168934","likes":0,"retweets":12,"category":"Chips","addedAt":1769581811554,"addedDate":"2026-01-28 17:30","media":null},{"id":"2016396323218739671","author":"Caitlin Johnstone","handle":"caitoz","text":"Cairo Takeaway was the restaurant where Murdoch's Daily Telegraph tried to orchestrate an antisemitic incident by having a guy go in wearing a Star of David hat trailed by a film crew hoping to catch the staff being abusive.

It’s looking increasingly likely to me that none of the leading AI labs will IPO until they reach valuations in the trillions, at which point retail investors will finally be able to get shares. In order for retail to get a 100x return on these investments, which was achievable for Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, the valuations of the AI labs will need to reach hundreds of trillions of dollars, meaning it’s likely too late for a more equitable redistribution of wealth.\n\nSimply put, you are currently exacerbating the problem. The consequences of this are that voters may take matters into their own hands and push for either or both 1) more aggressive / nonsensical forms of redistribution — the CA Founders’ Tax is just the beginning or 2) a drastic knee-capping of the AI industry in America, which make the CCP dominance scenario more likely.\n\nThe solution is to enable retail ownership now, increasing the number of Americans with economic exposure to Anthropic and other AI labs from hundreds of people to millions.","url":"https://x.com/vladtenev/status/2016332563879502219","media":null}},{"id":"1993166690641961113","author":"Xiaopeng He","handle":"xiaopenghexpeng","text":"Let this stand as the final proof: the robot that mastered the catwalk is built by a Chinese startup.  \n\nFollow me to join the journey.

This is old news&quot;.\n\nBut that's not what made his speech significant: he himself actually acknowledges in his speech that everyone “knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false [but] this fiction was useful.” And it's true, everyone did.\n\nSo the significance of his speech wasn't about him revealing new information but in the public act of saying it as someone who couldn't be more at the heart of the system, as the PM of Canada: a G7, Five Eyes, and NATO country, and the U.S.'s next door neighbor.

This is old news&quot;.\n\nBut that's not what made his speech significant: he himself actually acknowledges in his speech that everyone “knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false [but] this fiction was useful.” And it's true, everyone did.\n\nSo the significance of his speech wasn't about him revealing new information but in the public act of saying it as someone who couldn't be more at the heart of the system, as the PM of Canada: a G7, Five Eyes, and NATO country, and the U.S.'s next door neighbor. He isn't a passenger on the Western order - he *IS* the order, part of the architecture.\n\nA Thai person - or me, for that matter - could shout this at the top of their lungs for 15 years and it changes absolutely nothing structurally. Systems of power exist as long as the participants keep performing, even if they know it's bullshit. The significance of his speech is he publicly stopped performing, and encouraged his peers to do the same.\n\nThis changes things structurally as we're witnessing in real time. Latest example in date: you now have Keir Starmer, of all people, on his way to Beijing saying &quot;For years the narrative ran that China was the coming power, well now it has arrived. And the UK needs a China policy that recognises that reality&quot; (https://t.co/m3g5oHY00X).

The 1Q26 LPDDR price hikes mentioned in the news are pretty close to what I’ve heard. NAND flash increases, however, are a bit lower.\n\n2. iPhone memory pricing is now negotiated quarterly instead of every six months, so expect another hike in 2Q26. Right now, the 2Q26 QoQ increase looks similar to 1Q26.\n\n3. For most non-AI brands, even if you’re willing to pay up, there’s no guarantee you’ll get the supply. The fact that Apple can lock in a deal like this shows just how much leverage they have.\n\n4. Higher memory costs will hit iPhone gross margins. But Apple’s playbook is clear: use the market chaos to their advantage—secure the chips, absorb the costs, and grab more market share. They’ll make it back later on the services side.\n\n5. The cost pressure from memory could be a hot topic for investors and analysts at Apple’s earnings call this week. What Apple says could actually shake up other industries’ stocks more than Apple’s own or its suppliers'.\n\n6. Apple’s current plan for 2H26 new iPhone 18 models is to avoid raising prices as much as possible—at least keep the starting price flat, which is helpful for marketing.\n\n7.

Kimi K2.5 leaps ahead of GLM-4.7, DeepSeek V3.2 and Gemini 3 Pro. GDPval-AA is our leading metric for general agentic performance, measuring the performance of models on realistic knowledge work tasks such as preparing presentations and analysis. Models are given shell access and web browsing capabilities in an agentic loop via our reference agentic harness called Stirrup.\n\n➤ Native multimodality for the first time: Kimi K2.5 is the first flagship model from Moonshot to support multimodal (image and video) inputs. This is the first time that the leading open weights model has supported image input, removing a critical barrier to the adoption of open weights models compared to proprietary models from the frontier labs. It represents significant differentiation for Kimi K2.5 compared to other open weights leaders including DeepSeek V3.2, GLM-4.7, MiniMax M2.1 and MiMo-V2-Flash. Kimi K2.5 scores 75% on the MMMU Pro visual reasoning benchmark, slightly behind Gemini 3 Pro but in line with GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\n➤ Moderate cost to run Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index: Kimi K2.5 lands at $371 in Cost to Run Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, more than 4x cheaper than Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2, but more than 5x more expensive than DeepSeek V3.2 and gpt-oss-120b.\n\n➤ Moderate token usage: Kimi K2.5 demonstrates token usage comparable to other models in the same intelligence tier, using ~82M reasoning tokens across the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index evaluation suite. This is slightly lower than Kimi K2 Thinking (~95M reasoning tokens) and much lower than GLM 4.7 (~160M reasoning tokens).\n\n➤ Open weights: Kimi K2.5 is an MoE model with 1T total parameters and 32B active. Similar to Kimi K2 Thinking, Kimi K2.5 has been released in native INT4 precision rather than FP8/BF16. This means the model is only ~595GB.\n\n➤ Hybrid reasoning: Kimi K2.5 unifies Moonshot’s reasoning and non-reasoning models into a single model. We have evaluated K2.5 with reasoning on (and will share results soon with reasoning off).\n\n➤ Low hallucination rate: Kimi K2.5 scores -11 on the AA-Omniscience Index, our knowledge evaluation measuring both accuracy and hallucination rate. This score is primarily driven by a comparatively low hallucination rate of 64% (reduced from Kimi K2 Thinking’s 74%), indicating a slightly greater tendency to abstain rather than fabricate knowledge when the model is uncertain.","url":"https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2016250137115557953","likes":40,"retweets":9,"category":"Chips","addedAt":1769547729201,"addedDate":"2026-01-28 08:02","media":"image"},{"id":"2016250150646415755","author":"Artificial Analysis","handle":"ArtificialAnlys","text":"Individual results from our Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index set of evaluations: https://t.co/gx5LqLNWDh","url":"https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2016250150646415755","likes":2,"retweets":0,"category":"Chips","addedAt":1769547729201,"addedDate":"2026-01-28 08:02","media":"image"},{"id":"2016249407549931977","author":"0.005 Seconds (3/694)","handle":"seconds_0","text":".......... i can just fork codex and wire up a command to feed the current repo to gptPro that way","url":"https://x.com/seconds_0/status/2016249407549931977","likes":9,"retweets":0,"category":"AI","addedAt":1769547729201,"addedDate":"2026-01-28 08:02","media":null},{"id":"2016248212986765424","author":"@levelsio","handle":"levelsio","text":"Best thing Anthropic could do now is acquire Clawdbot (or now Moltbot, an absolutely terrible name btw, should be Lobsterbot or smth) and built it into Claude I think","url":"https://x.com/levelsio/status/2016248212986765424","likes":112,"retweets":3,"category":"AI","addedAt":1769547729201,"addedDate":"2026-01-28 08:02","media":null},{"id":"2016247117098954968","author":"Eric Newcomer","handle":"EricNewcomer","text":"Foundation Future Seeks $3 Billion Valuation as Ex-Synapse CEO Tries Robotics Comeback @cityofthetown  https://t.co/UBdm6HhSOe","url":"https://x.com/EricNewcomer/status/2016247117098954968","likes":0,"retweets":0,"category":"Tech Biz","addedAt":1769545809221,"addedDate":"2026-01-28 07:30","media":null},{"id":"2016245613923287264","author":"Joe Weisenthal","handle":"TheStalwart","text":"Real talk.
