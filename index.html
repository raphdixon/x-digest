As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn’t want to be here anymore.\n\nHaving bipolar disorder is notable state of constant mental illness. When you go into a manic episode, you are ill at that point. When you are not in an episode, you are completely ‘normal’. And that’s when the wreckage from the illness hits the hardest. Hitting rock bottom a few months ago, my wife encouraged me to finally get help.\n\nI have found comfort in Reddit forums of all places. Different people speak of being in manic or depressive episodes of a similar nature. I read their stories and realized that I was not alone. It’s not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day and being told by the so-called best doctors in the world that I am not bipolar, but merely experiencing “symptoms of autism.”\n\nMy words as a leader in my community have global impact and influence. In my mania, I lost complete sight of that.\n\nAs I find my new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise, and clean living, I have newfound, much-needed clarity. I am pouring my energy into positive, meaningful art: music, clothing, design, and other new ideas to help the world.\n\nI’m not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness. I write today simply to ask for your patience and understanding as I find my way home.”\n\nWith love,\n\nYe\n\n(via Walla Street Journal)","url":"https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/2015784919402750190","likes":19444,"retweets":816,"category":"Tech Biz","date":"2026-01-27"},{"id":"2015851783655194640","author":"Claude","handle":"claudeai","text":"Your work tools are now interactive in Claude.\n\nDraft Slack messages, visualize ideas as Figma diagrams, or build and see Asana timelines. https://t.co/ROWwUOU5vA","url":"https://x.com/claudeai/status/2015851783655194640","likes":6097,"retweets":419,"category":"AI","date":"2026-01-27"},{"id":"2015809201298350295","author":"Nancy Pelosi Stock Tracker ♟","handle":"pelositracker","text":"BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi just filed ~$69M worth of new stock trades\n\nIncluding selling $50M of Apple $AAPL\n\nMajor sells include:\n- Sold $50M shares of Apple $AAPL\n- Sold $5M shares of Nvidia $NVDA\n- Sold $5M shares of Disney $DIS\n\nShe bought new call options:\n- Bought $500K of $GOOGL LEAPS\n- Bought $500K of Amazon $AMZN LEAPS\n- Bought $500K of Apple $AAPL LEAPS\n- Bought $250K of Nvidia $NVDA LEAPS\n\nFull set of trades in following tweet","url":"https://x.com/pelositracker/status/2015809201298350295","likes":19319,"retweets":2667,"category":"Chips","date":"2026-01-27"},{"id":"2015859375735275709","author":"Barrett Linburg","handle":"DallasAptGP","text":"I downloaded Claude in Excel on Friday night and didn't stop until I hit my Claude Max limits. Multiple times.\n\nMy Excel skills are average at best. But I understand real estate. I understand taxes, Opportunity Zones, depreciation, compounding, waterfalls.\n\nI know when the numbers are right and when they're wrong.\n\nSo I talked Claude through building a model that had only ever existed in my head.\n\nThe result: a 30-year Opportunity Zone fund model with capital recycling. One of the most complex financial structures you can build in a spreadsheet.\n\n14 interconnected sheets. 360-month engine. 378 rows × 114 columns tracking 13 deals simultaneously, month by month.\n\nHere's what makes this hard:\n\nDynamic deal triggering. Deals aren't hardcoded. They auto-generate when cumulative refinance proceeds hit a funding threshold. The model decides when to deploy capital based on what's actually available.\n\n13 stacked, interdependent deals. Each has its own timeline: construction → stabilization → refi → refi 2 → exit. The timing of one deal triggers the next. Miss one link and the whole chain breaks.\n\nMulti-phase waterfall. Pref → return of capital → GP catch-up → 80/20 split. The LP/GP economics flip mid-stream. The model tracks allocations across both phases.\n\nOZ tax basis tracking. Original deferred gain. 10% basis step-up at Year 5. Deferred gain tax due Year 6. K-1 losses flowing through annually. Full exclusion of appreciation after Year 10. All tracked separately for LP and GP.\n\nDepreciation allocation differently before and after the waterfall flip. The model knows the difference.\n\nAfter-tax IRR. Most models stop at pre-tax returns. This one calculates true after-tax performance including K-1 loss utilization, deferred gain payments, and OZ exclusion benefits.\n\n8 automated validation checks. All passing.\n\nI built it in a weekend by having a conversation.","url":"https://x.com/DallasAptGP/status/2015859375735275709","likes":866,"retweets":38,"category":"Tech Biz","date":"2026-01-27"},{"id":"2015853248431980704","author":"Yuchen Jin","handle":"Yuchenj_UW","text":"This is 100x more useful than Clawdbot, isn’t it?\n\nStill don’t get why people are buying Apple Mac minis to run Clawdbot.","url":"https://x.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/2015853248431980704","likes":1382,"retweets":34,"category":"Tech","date":"2026-01-27","quotedTweet":{"author":"Claude","handle":"claudeai","text":"Your work tools are now interactive in Claude.\n\nDraft Slack messages, visualize ideas as Figma diagrams, or build and see Asana timelines. https://t.co/ROWwUOU5vA","url":"https://x.com/claudeai/status/2015851783655194640"}},{"id":"2015829869020508442","author":"Gemini CLI","handle":"geminicli","text":"This video was created entirely within Gemini CLI...\n\n... in under 10 prompts 🪄\n\nWith a few detailed prompts you can create high quality motion videos thanks to the Remotion Agent Skill.\n\n👇Give Agent Skills a try today in Gemini CLI! https://t.co/s5Op8dJUWq","url":"https://x.com/geminicli/status/2015829869020508442","likes":883,"retweets":58,"category":"AI","date":"2026-01-27","quotedTweet":{"author":"Remotion","handle":"Remotion","text":"Remotion now has Agent Skills - make videos just with Claude Code!\n\n$ npx skills add remotion-dev/skills\n\nThis animation was created just by prompting 👇 https://t.co/hadnkHlG6E","url":"https://x.com/Remotion/status/2013626968386765291"}},{"id":"2015525437972095151","author":"𝔪𝔬𝔯𝔤 📚","handle":"saint_morg","text":"zohran mamdani on a random sunday while the entire country is falling apart https://t.co/PqZgowHfSc","url":"https://x.com/saint_morg/status/2015525437972095151","likes":163481,"retweets":12693,"category":"Chips","date":"2026-01-27","quotedTweet":{"author":"WILLIAMSBURG NEWS","handle":"WMSBG","text":".⁦@NYCMayor⁩ ⁦@ZohranKMamdani⁩ is seen shoveling snow on Myrtle Ave &amp;amp; Franklin Ave, helping out a stuck car in the snow. https://t.co/GNe8AJO2iS","url":"https://x.com/WMSBG/status/2015502297577537625"}},{"id":"2015849410479964321","author":"intern","handle":"intern","text":"engineers watching the BD team use claude code https://t.co/d3HzsFLoyH","url":"https://x.com/intern/status/2015849410479964321","likes":1011,"retweets":52,"category":"AI","date":"2026-01-27"},{"id":"2015624212132905208","author":"Chris Olah","handle":"ch402","text":"I try to not talk about politics.
